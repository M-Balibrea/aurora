      'Buildings are key players when looking at end-use energy demand. It is for this reason that during the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been considered as a tool that could bring great opportunities for energy reduction via the accurate monitoring and control of a large variety of energy-related agents in buildings. However, there is a lack of IoT platforms specifically oriented towards the proper processing, management and analysis of such large and diverse data. In this context, we put forward in this paper the IoT Energy Platform (IoTEP) which attempts to provide the first holistic solution for the management of IoT energy data. The platform we show here (that has been based on FIWARE) is suitable to include several functionalities and features that are key when dealing with energy quality insurance and support for data analytics. As part of this work, we have tested the platform IoTEP with a real use case that includes data and information from three buildings totalizing hundreds of sensors. The platform has exceed expectations proving robust, plastic and versatile for the application at hand.',

      'This paper presents the main foundations of big data applied to smart cities. A general Internet of Things based architecture is proposed to be applied to different smart cities applications. We describe two scenarios of big data analysis. One of them illustrates some services implemented in the smart campus of the University of Murcia. The second one is focused on a tram service scenario, where thousands of transit-card transactions should be processed. Results obtained from both scenarios show the potential of the applicability of this kind of techniques to provide profitable services of smart cities, such as the management of the energy consumption and comfort in smart buildings, and the detection of travel profiles in smart transport.',

      'The massive collection of data via emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) requires finding optimal ways to reduce the created features that have a potential impact on the information that can be extracted through the machine learning process. The mining of knowledge related to a concept is done on the basis of the features of data. The process of finding the best combination of features is called feature selection. In this paper we deal with multivariate time-dependent series of data points for energy forecasting in smart buildings. We propose a methodology to transform the time-dependent database into a structure that standard machine learning algorithms can process, and then, apply different types of feature selection methods for regression tasks. We used Weka for the tasks of database transformation, feature selection, regression, statistical test and forecasting. The proposed methodology improves MAE by 59.97% and RMSE by 40.75%, evaluated on training data, and it improves MAE by 42.28% and RMSE by 36.62%, evaluated on test data, on average for 1-step-ahead, 2-step-ahead and 3-step-ahead when compared to not applying any feature selection methodology.',
